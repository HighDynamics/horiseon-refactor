# Code Refactor For Horiseon

Several changes were made to improve SEO and meet Accessibility Standards as well as improving the code for long-term sustainability.

## HTML
Replaced all content-filled `<div>` tags with `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>` or `<article>` tags.
* This improves __SEO__ and __Accessibility__ by semantically grouping similar content together in a way a search engine or screen reader can better comprehend.

Updated content in `<title>` tag.
* This improves __SEO__ and __Accessibility__ by displaying a clear title in the browser window or tab as well as giving the search engine a unique title to look for.

## CSS
Consolidated supurflous css rules and added comments to structure css file.
* This improves __long-term sustainablity__ by displaying clear sections to the css file, similar in structure to the html. This will help future developers work with and understand the file.

## Extra
Resized the content images and icons.
* This improves the loading time of the website.
