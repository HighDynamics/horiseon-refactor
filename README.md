# Code Refactor For Horiseon

Several changes were made to improve SEO and meet Accessibility Standards as well as improving the code for long-term sustainability.

## HTML
Replaced all content-filled `<div>` tags with `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>` or `<article>` tags.
*This improves **SEO** and **Accessibility** by semantically grouping similar content together in a way a search engine or screen reader can better comprehend.

## CSS
